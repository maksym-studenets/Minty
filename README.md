# Minty
Graph shortest path computation using Minty's algorithm
This application is an implementation of almost-Minty's algorithm for finding shotest path in a network represented in a form of a graph.
A graph is represented in a form of an adjacency matrix. A user can enter the matrix interactively by selecting a number of nodes and then enter the corresponding values 
OR load an existing network definition from a JSON file.
The program also displays the constructed graph.
